# Complex-Transformations
I developed this code while taking a course called "Complex Analysis" because there were minimal resources available online for visualising transformations of complex functions.
This code is designed in a "user-input" fashion, which allows the user to input the (complex) function/transformation and define the ranges for both the z and w planes. The user can also input details of other mathematical objects such as lines, circles, and so on to see how they are transformed.
